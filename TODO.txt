A TODO list for our report and code repository
Report:
- create a visualization of training and testing data for our report (bar graph visualization for the report)
- create a graph to represent the relation between classes, what is the overlap between different types of toxic comments?
  -if a comment is class 1 does that affect the probability of it being class 2? (something for the report)

Code:
- interpret data from CSV file into X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test --DONE
- clean up data by removing stop words and excess noise --DONE
- turn data into a TFIDF vector --DONE

- create nlp basis
- tune hyper-parameters
- use cross-validation function on training data for better results
